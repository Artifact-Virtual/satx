## 🎯 NEXT STEPS TO GET FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup (Days 1-2)

1. **☐ Acquire Hardware**
   - [ ] Purchase RTL-SDR dongle (RTL2832U + R820T2)
   - [ ] Get antenna (QFH, Turnstile, or simple whip)
   - [ ] USB extension cable
   - [ ] Coax cable + adapters

2. **☐ Build/Install Antenna**
   - [ ] Follow `docs/antenna_build.md`
   - [ ] Mount antenna with clear sky view
   - [ ] Connect to RTL-SDR with coax

### Phase 2: Software Installation (Day 3)

3. **☐ Install System Dependencies**
   
   **Linux:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\_devSpace\SATx
   chmod +x scripts/install_tools.sh
   ./scripts/install_tools.sh
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   - Follow `docs/windows_setup.md`
   - Install Python, Git, RTL-SDR drivers
   - Use WSL2 for best results

4. **☐ Install Python Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **☐ Test RTL-SDR Connection**
   ```bash
   rtl_test -t
   ```
   Expected: "Found 1 device(s)"

### Phase 3: Configuration (Day 3)

6. **☐ Configure Station Location**
   
   Edit `configs/station.ini`:
   ```ini
   [station]
   name = YourStation
   latitude = YOUR_LAT    # e.g., 24.8607
   longitude = YOUR_LON   # e.g., 67.0011
   elevation = YOUR_ALT   # meters
   ```

7. **☐ Fetch Initial TLE Data**
   ```bash
   python scripts/fetch_tles.py
   ```
   This downloads ~10,000 satellite orbits.

8. **☐ Test Pass Predictions**
   ```bash
   python scripts/predict_passes.py
   ```
   You should see list of upcoming satellite passes.

### Phase 4: First Test Recording (Day 4)

9. **☐ Record Test Pass**
   
   **Option A: Manual Recording (Easy)**
   
   Find a pass from predictions, then:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/start_recording.sh 25544 437800000 2400000 600 recordings/test.iq
   ```
   
   **Option B: Automated (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python scripts/scheduler.py
   ```
   Runs continuously, records all passes automatically.

10. **☐ Process Recording**
    ```bash
    python scripts/process_recording.py recordings/test.iq
    ```
    
    Generates:
    - `test.png` - Spectrogram image
    - `test.candidates.json` - Detected signals
    - Entry in `logs/candidates.csv`

### Phase 5: Validation & Optimization (Days 5-7)

11. **☐ Validate Detections**
    - Compare your recordings with known satellites
    - Check SatNOGS for similar observations
    - Join community forums (r/RTLSDR, SatNOGS)

12. **☐ Optimize Setup**
    - Adjust antenna position for better SNR
    - Fine-tune gain settings (try 40-49 dB)
    - Test different frequency bands

13. **☐ Install Decoders**
    ```bash
    # Install gr-satellites for protocol decoding
    git clone https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites.git
    cd gr-satellites
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make && sudo make install
    ```

14. **☐ Try Decoding Known Signals**
    
    **NOAA Weather Satellites (Easy):**
    ```bash
    # Record NOAA pass at 137.5 MHz
    # Decode with WXtoImg or gr-satellites
    ```
    
    **ISS Packet Radio:**
    ```bash
    gr_satellites recordings/iss.iq --norad 25544 --samp_rate 2.4e6
    ```

### Phase 6: Integration (Ongoing)

15. **☐ SatNOGS Integration** (Optional)
    - Create account at network.satnogs.org
    - Register your station
    - Follow `docs/satnogs_integration.md`

16. **☐ ML Model Training** (Advanced)
    - Collect labeled spectrograms
    - Train signal detector
    - See `models/model_v1/README.md`

## 🔧 Quick Verification Checklist

Before starting automated operations, verify:

- [ ] `rtl_test` shows device detected
- [ ] TLEs downloaded (`data/tles/all-satellites.tle` exists)
- [ ] Pass predictions work (shows upcoming passes)
- [ ] `configs/station.ini` has correct coordinates
- [ ] Can record I/Q file successfully
- [ ] Can process recording and generate spectrogram
- [ ] Antenna is mounted with clear view of sky

## 📊 Expected Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Tasks |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Hardware | 1-3 days | Order, receive, build antenna |
| Software | 0.5 day  | Install dependencies |
| Config   | 0.5 day  | Setup station, fetch TLEs |
| Testing  | 1-2 days | First recordings, validation |
| Optimize | Ongoing  | Improve setup, add features |

**Total to operational:** ~3-7 days depending on hardware availability.
